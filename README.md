# Premier-League-Predictor

### Description 
As the world cup has just ended, club football has once again resumed. One of the most thrilling and exciting football leagues in the world is the **English Premier League**. Using a collection of data on the 2018-19 season I built a predictive classification model that predicts whether the home team wins a match given the match statistics. I used a random forest model as my method of machine learning. 

### The data.
